## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Bootstrap  
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

This project has given brief hands-on on CSS Box Model parameters majorly margin, padding and other display, font properties.
I have developed this project in 2 ways
1) Refer styles.css -- without CSS Flexbox.
2) Refer styles2.css -- with CSS Flexbox.

An implementation done using flex, has responsiveness to some extend.
The breakpoint settting is at 800px.

### Continued development

Flexbox are of great use one dimensional patterns. 
CSS grid can also be used instead of Flexbox.
